### Dataset One
1. Name of Data: **Tree Canopy Cover**
2. Description of Data: This dataset covers both existing and potential tree coverage in Los Angeles County from 2016. This would give me a good idea of where most of the current tree coverage is, and where there is land capable of establishing or expanding tree coverage. I am concerned the data is a bit old, but could not seem to find a newer source for Los Angeles County. It would be interesting to see if that data is publicly available and if so, whether the potential tree coverage was actually used to plant more or maintain existing trees. Essentially, was there an increase/decrease/no change in tree coverage from 2016 - 2022?

### Dataset Two
1. Name of Data: **Homeownership**
2. Description of Data: This dataset covers both homeownership and renter rate in Los Angeles County from 2010-2021. I would like to cross-reference this dataset with the dataset above (Tree Canopy Cover) to see whether there might be some correlation between homeowners or renters and access to street trees because of how public trees in Los Angeles are planted and maintained. I wonder if renters may be less likely to have access to street trees because landlords would prefer not to take on potential costs associated with maintaining a public street tree.

### Dataset Three
1. Name of Data: **Housing Stability**
2. Description of Data: This dataset covers housing stability, defined by USC Neighborhood Data for Social Change as "the percentage of households living in the same housing unit as they were one year ago" in Los Angeles County from 2010-2021. I wonder if this dataset could be a good indicator for gentrification and displacement.

### Dataset Four
1. Name of Data: **Vacant Properties**
2. Description of Data: This dataset covers both vacant commercial and vacant residential properties in Los Angeles County from 2012-2021. I would like to cross-reference this dataset with the dataset above (Housing Stability) to see if there is any correlation between the two, similarly to see if it might be a good indicator for gentrification and displacement.
3. Source URL: https://la.myneighborhooddata.org/2021/06/vacant-properties/ This data was originally sourced from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development and USPS Administrative Data on Vacant Properties, but downloadable from USC Neighborhood Data for Social Change.
