## Hello! I'm Brittney Lu (she/hers) :wave:
I am a third year dual-degree masters student, studying public health (community health sciences) and urban planning (design and development) at UCLA. I am originally from and grew up in Bakersfield, moved to San Diego for undergrad, and have since lived in Los Angeles for the past five years. I also work as a community organizer supporting efforts around ending neighborhood oil drilling. For fun, I love reading:book:, swimming:swimmer:, trying new food:fork_and_knife:, and exploring new places:world_map:.    
### course description
From my understanding, this course aims to build knowledge in spatial data science and skills in Python programming so that we can work together to analyze and visualize data for urban planning. 
### project ideas
Some project topics that I would be interested to explore are any relationships between urban tree canopy coverage and properties that are owned versus rented, or any relationships between vacant sites or brownfield redevelopment and gentrification + displacement.
### objectives
I am hoping to develop a greater understanding of how we can use spatial data science to advance urban justice, and to gain better skills in data analysis, coding, and mapping.
